<p><strong>IoT Project, A.A. 2022/2023 - Smart Nursery Plant</strong></p><p><img src="https://github.com/giuliocapecchi/IoT-project/blob/main/images/IoT%20project.png?raw=true" alt="Project Image"></p><p>This repository showcases the implementation of the Smart Nursery Plant, an IoT project aimed to combine plant care with modern-day technology. Using a combination of CoAP actuators, MQTT sensors and a border router, this work brings automation and intelligence to the nurturing of plants, ensuring their optimal growth and health.</p><p><strong>Project Overview:</strong></p><p>In this project, we have created a system that leverages the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) to create an intelligent and automated plant care environment. The Smart Nursery Plant utilizes three CoAP actuators, in order to regulate temperature, CO2 levels, and the humidity value. Additionally, three MQTT sensors collect real-time data, enabling precise monitoring and control of these vital parameters for plant growth.</p></li><p><strong>Border Router:</strong> The border router serves as the gateway between the IoT devices and the system we developed. It enables remote monitoring and control of the plant care system.</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><ul>
