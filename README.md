<p><strong>Welcome to the Smart Nursery Plant Project</strong></p><p><img src="https://github.com/giuliocapecchi/IoT-project/blob/main/images/IoT%20project.png?raw=true" alt="Project Image"></p><p>This repository showcases the implementation of the Smart Nursery Plant, an innovative IoT project aimed at revolutionizing plant care through advanced technology. Using a combination of CoAP actuators, MQTT dongles, and a border router, this project brings automation and intelligence to the nurturing of plants, ensuring their optimal growth and health.</p><p><strong>Project Overview:</strong></p><p>In this project, we have created a system that leverages the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) to create an intelligent and automated plant care environment. The Smart Nursery Plant utilizes three CoAP actuators to regulate temperature, CO2 levels, and humidity. Additionally, three MQTT dongles collect real-time data from temperature, CO2 level, and humidity sensors, enabling precise monitoring and control of these vital parameters for plant growth.</p><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>CoAP Actuators:</strong> We have incorporated three CoAP actuators into the system, each responsible for regulating temperature, CO2 levels, and humidity. These actuators enable precise adjustments to create and maintain the ideal growth environment for the plants.</p></li><li><p><strong>MQTT Dongles:</strong> With three MQTT dongles strategically placed, the system collects real-time data from sensors measuring temperature, CO2 levels, and humidity. These sensors provide crucial information, allowing the system to make informed decisions for optimal plant care.</p></li><li><p><strong>Border Router:</strong> The border router serves as the gateway between the IoT devices and the external world. It enables external access to the network, facilitating remote monitoring and control of the plant care system.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Usage:</strong></p><p>To experience the functionality of the Smart Nursery Plant, follow these steps:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Set Up Hardware:</strong> Make sure you have the required hardware components â€“ three CoAP actuators, three MQTT dongles, and one border router. Connect them according to the provided documentation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Install Dependencies:</strong> Check out the requirements listed in the documentation and install any necessary dependencies on your system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Configuration:</strong> Configure the MQTT dongles to communicate with the temperature, CO2 level, and humidity sensors. Set up the CoAP actuators to regulate the corresponding parameters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Run the Application:</strong> Execute the provided application script to start the Smart Nursery Plant system. This script will establish communication among the devices and begin monitoring and control operations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monitor and Control:</strong> Access the provided web-based interface (or command-line interface, as per your implementation) to monitor real-time data from sensors and control the CoAP actuators to optimize the plant's environment.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Contributions:</strong></p><p>We welcome contributions to enhance the functionality and features of the Smart Nursery Plant project. Whether you're interested in adding more sensors, refining control algorithms, or improving the user interface, your ideas and contributions are valuable.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong></p><p>We extend our gratitude to the IoT Project 2023 course for providing the framework and inspiration for this project. The combination of CoAP actuators, MQTT dongles, and a border router has enabled the creation of a truly innovative Smart Nursery Plant system.</p><p>Let's join hands to make plant care smarter and more efficient through the power of IoT!</p></div></div>
